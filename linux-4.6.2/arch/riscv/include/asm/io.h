 * ioremap_nocache     -   map bus memory into CPU space

 * make bus memory CPU accessible via the readb/readw/readl/writeb/
 * writew/writel functions and the other mmio helpers. The returned
 * address is not guaranteed to be usable directly as a virtual
 * address.
 *
 * This version of ioremap ensures that the memory is marked uncachable
 * on the CPU as well as honouring existing caching rules from things like
 * the PCI bus. Note that there are other caches and buffers on many
 * busses. In particular driver authors should read up on PCI writes.
 *
 * It's useful if some control registers are in such an area and
 * write combining or read caching is not desirable.
